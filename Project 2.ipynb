    "Prison diets are known to be high in carbohydrates and sodium levels with little or no access to fresh produce. Often, this results in adverse health outcomes and can lead to increased spendings for medical needs. The goal of this project is to identify the minimum cost diet that satisfies nutritional needs for U.S. inmate population using available data on county, state, and federal prisons. We will come up with a minimum cost diet for the average prisoner and investigate whether or not state prisons are able to meet the suggested nutritional requirements based on their weekly menus."
