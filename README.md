# EEP 153 Project 2
GitHub Repository for ENVECON 153 Project 2 â€“ Team Margaret Reid

## Overview  
This repository contains all materials and code related to our project for ENVECON 153. This project is interested in finding the minimum-cost diet for incarcerated individuals across U.S. prisons, including county, state, and federal. We will examine differences across age groups and gender. We aim to analyze the nutritional adequacy and cost efficiency of these diets while exploring potential improvements.  

## Project Goals  

### Primary Objectives:  
- **Develop a minimum-cost diet** for U.S. state and federal prison populations that meets nutritional requirements.  
- **Analyze diet composition** to determine costs and variations based on age, sex, and activity level.  
- **Compare our findings with existing prison diets** to assess whether current meals meet dietary constraints.  
- **Identify potential improvements** to prison diets that could enhance nutrition while maintaining cost efficiency.
